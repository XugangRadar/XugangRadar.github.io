**Xu Gang**, IEEE member and CIE member, received the Ph.D degree in electrical engineering from [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn) in 2015. From 2015 to 2016, he was a full-time Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE), Nanyang Technological University ([NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg)), Singapore. Since 2016, he is an associate professor with the [State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves](https://mmw.seu.edu.cn), Southeast University. His major research interests include radar imaging technology, image processing in remote sensing, sparse signal processing, statistical machine learning, artificial intelligence and etc. He has fully been in charge of and participated in several projects of national grade, such as National Natural Science Foundation of China, national 973 projection, national 863 project, intentional cooperation and etc. His Ph.D thesis has won the university’s excellent graduation thesis, Shaanxi province’s excellent graduation thesis and the nomination award of first CIE excellent graduation thesis. In recent years, he has first authored over 10 technical publications on the international TOP journals, such as [IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6245518), [IEEE Trans. on Geoscience and Remote Sensing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=36) and [IEEE Trans. on Imaging Processing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=83).
